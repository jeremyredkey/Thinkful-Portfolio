						<h2>Hello, I'm Jeremy &amp; I Love the Internet!</h2>
				
					<p><strong>I am currently a Web Developer at San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital located in Banning, California and have been at my job for almost 4 wonderful years! I'm a simple man, I enjoy long coding sessions by the beach with good coffee. I currently live in Banning, California and am happy that I have very short commutes to work.</strong>
          <br>
          <strong>I think what sets me apart from others is my unwaivering optimism and grit when facing any challenge in life. I also have a deep love for learning new technologies that will continue throughout my career.</strong>
          </p>

              Description: The Super Character Finder App helps user to find their favorite fantasy character and get general information about them. Think like a focused google search for your favorite super heroes, and villains. Also, give movie suggestions based on user search.

              <h3>Loan Calculator App</h3><br/>
							<a href="https://github.com/jeremyredkey/LoanCalcApp">Github Repo</a><br/>
              Description: I was inspired by <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/loan" target="_blank">Credit Karma's application</a> so I created an app like it without the Credit Score options dropdown selector. The purpose of this application was to test my abilities to manipulate the DOM with Javascript while creating a tool that can help financial loan officers. This required a simple form UI that was really easy because of Bootstrap 4 classes and responsiveness. To build this application I used Bootstrap 4, a little CSS, and Vanilla Javascript ES6. I learned many things from this project but the biggest help was once I found <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseFloat" target="_blank">parseFloat() on MDN</a> (this is particularly useful when dealing with money). Also I learned the formula on how to calculate loan total interest, monthly payment, and total payment by using this website:

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I'm passionate about creating complex but addictive applications that the world can enjoy. I'm a team player who always looks forward to facing projects as a group and collaborating about new ideas to help exceed users' needs.</p>
							
              <p>
              I just started Thinkful Engineer Flex Program to help strengthen my programming skills, level up my workflow, widen my network, and hopefully after a lot of hard work I will land a dream job. I'm currently working as a Web Developer right now but I want to be the best I can be in my field. I'm driven to learn every day and I believe with my continual hands-on experience at Thinkful I will be aptly prepared to be an exceptional member of any team. I have experience with using HTML5 and CSS3 as well as SASS/LESS. Furthermore, I'm comfortable with setting up virtual/physical LAMP web servers in a hospital environment, writing clean Javascript/PHP, and creating custom WordPress themes/plugins.</p>
                  <p>When I'm not programming I'm either:</p>
							<ol><!-- Hobbies besides programming in a ordered list -->
                <li>Tasting new coffee brews</li>
								<li>Learning new songs on the guitar</li>
								<li>Hiking new peaks all around California</li>
								<li>Vacationing in Mammoth Mountain</li>
								<li>Soaking up the sun at the Beach</li>
							</ol>
